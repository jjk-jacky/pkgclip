# 06/26/2012; v1.0.1

- A little bug in the display of the list of packages was fixed. It seems to sometimes (on
32bits system only?) lead to a crash of PkgClip right after info about all packages have
been loaded (from pacman's cache); which by default was done on application's start.


# 05/10/2012; v1.0.0

- Added buttons to "Select previous/next marked package" to allow quick & easy
review of marked packages

- Added menus for "Select previous/next marked package" and "Remove marked packages",
all with accelerators

- Added minimum command line options (--help, --version)

- Under certain conditions, all sizes on the list could show as "128 TiB" (in
list only, tooltips & total were correct), fixed

- Other minor fixes

- Bumped to 1.0.0 to follow semantic versioning


# 02/07/2012; v0.1.2

- Added "As Installed" list, to treat packages as if they were installed.

For packages installed, this will have no effect. For others, the most recent
version will be treated as if it was installed, then same thing (i.e. regarding
older pkgrel, etc)

This can be useful for non-installed packages that one wants to keep, when
they're needed on occasion (e.g. to compile something...)

- Added option to specify number of old versions to keep specific to packages
on "As Installed" list.


# 01/18/2012; v0.1.1
