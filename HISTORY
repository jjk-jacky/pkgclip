# 2013-05-12; v1.2.1

- Loading packages is now done in a separate thread, so it should be/feel faster

- Remove option "sane sort indicator" (See GTK's own gtk-alternative-sort-arrows
instead)


# 2013-04-05; v1.2.0

- Compatibility with API changes of pacman 4.1


# 2012-10-27; v1.1.0

- Use package description as tooltip for the Package column

- Add a panel to show info about the focused item

Info on panel can be defined through config option PkgInfo. Markup syntax is
supported for formatting, as well as the following variables: $NAME, $DESC,
$VERSION, $FILE, $SIZE, $RECOMM and $REASON

- Update polkit policy: use auth_admin for all, add message & icon

- pkgclip's source code moved from a mercurial repo
(https://bitbucket.org/jjacky/pkgclip) to a git one
(https://github.com/jjk-jacky/pkgclip)

- Add option --enable-git-version to configure. When enabled, the version used
in pkgclip (and man page) will come from `git describe` ran at compile/make
time.


# 2012-06-26; v1.0.1

- A little bug in the display of the list of packages was fixed. It seems to sometimes (on
32bits system only?) lead to a crash of PkgClip right after info about all packages have
been loaded (from pacman's cache); which by default was done on application's start.


# 2012-05-10; v1.0.0

- Added buttons to "Select previous/next marked package" to allow quick & easy
review of marked packages

- Added menus for "Select previous/next marked package" and "Remove marked packages",
all with accelerators

- Added minimum command line options (--help, --version)

- Under certain conditions, all sizes on the list could show as "128 TiB" (in
list only, tooltips & total were correct), fixed

- Other minor fixes

- Bumped to 1.0.0 to follow semantic versioning


# 2012-02-07; v0.1.2

- Added "As Installed" list, to treat packages as if they were installed.

For packages installed, this will have no effect. For others, the most recent
version will be treated as if it was installed, then same thing (i.e. regarding
older pkgrel, etc)

This can be useful for non-installed packages that one wants to keep, when
they're needed on occasion (e.g. to compile something...)

- Added option to specify number of old versions to keep specific to packages
on "As Installed" list.


# 2012-01-18; v0.1.1

- Refresh reasons after removing files


# 2012-01-17, v0.1.0

- first release
